## Introduction
SER-515 Foundations of software engineering project, Group 2
The primary purpose of the project is to get accustomed with the software engineering lifecycle. We are using Scrum Agile methodology for development of the project.
### Purpose
Design a virtual rover which can explore the unknown region and come back with the map of the explored region. With the rover we can inspect the region which is not accessible by humans due to some constraints like not enough space to fit a human body, or booby traps, lack of oxygen.
